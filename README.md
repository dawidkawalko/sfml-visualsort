# sfml-visualsort
Visualization of sorting algorithms using C++ and SFML 
-

- Allows for simple visualization of different sorting algorithms.
- Uses colors and animation to give a better understanding of how each of the algorithms works.
- Counts the number of operations executed by the algorithm (this includes comparisons and swaps).
- Very straightforward to create and implement new algorithms.
- Available algorithms:
  - Bubble sort


Instructions: Press `space` to start sorting or `R` to reset (re-shuffle) the values.
